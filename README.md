# FlashcardInator
my midterm project , an extension for creating study-flashcards from browser 
comming soon , be patient . 

the basic idea is :


Flashcards-browser-extension ? NHAY it is flashcard-INATOR ! 

“I call it the flashcard- INATOR" 

Find something online you want to remember? Highlight it, click a thing, and it's a flashcard. This is a browser extension to do exactly that  

Now how does it work exaclty , well there are bucket sets  with buckets , initially empty , and each bucket represents  a difficulty of the flashcards , each flashcards when created gets put into bucket one and gets promoted to next bucket depending on how easy it was to answer for the user , the difficulty is easy , hard or medium . Also instead of mouse clicks the user can use a webcam and hand pose detection like a “like ” for easy and dislike for difficult . This is the basic idea i want to create , i might sprinckle in some features durring “development ” , we will see
